    answer: "The IDV is the maximum amount you can claim in case of total loss or theft of your vehicle. It decreases with the vehicle's age.",
    
},
{
    question: "Do I need to report a minor accident if I don’t plan to file a claim?",
    answer: "It’s advisable to report all accidents, even minor ones, as it could affect future claims or policy renewals."
},
{
    question: "Can I claim for damage caused by someone else?",
    answer: "Yes, if another party is responsible, you can claim against their insurance, or your insurer may pursue recovery on your behalf."
}, {
    question: "What is the process for claiming total loss or theft of my vehicle?",
    answer: "In case of total loss or theft, you’ll need to provide a police report, the vehicle’s RC (Registration Certificate), and other documents as required by your insurer."
}, {
    question: "Will my premium increase after filing a vehicle insurance claim",
    answer: "Filing a claim can affect your premium at renewal, depending on the claim type and your policy terms."
}, {
    question: "How long does it take to process a vehicle insurance claim?",

}, {
    question: "What is a deductible, and how does it affect my vehicle insurance claim?",
    answer: " A deductible is the amount you pay out of pocket before your insurance coverage kicks in. It’s deducted from the total claim amount."
}, {
    question: "Can I choose any garage for repairs, or do I need to use a network garage?",
    answer: "You can choose any garage, but using a network garage may provide benefits like cashless repairs and faster claim processing."

}, {
    question: "How do I track the status of my vehicle insurance claim?",
    answer: " You can track the status of your claim through the application, where you’ll receive real-time updates."
},
{
    question: " What Motor Insurance cover should I buy? Should I buy Comprehensive Insurance or Liability only Policy?",
    answer: " Third Party Liability insurance is mandatory for all vehicles plying on public roads in India. This covers Liability for injuries and damages to others that you are responsible for. In addition, it is prudent to cover loss or damages to the vehicle itself by way of a Comprehensive/Package policy or a Bundled Policy or a Standalone Own Damage Policy in addition to your Liability Only Policy, which covers both Liability as well as Own damage to Insured vehicle. Liability Only cover is also known as Act Only cover."
},
{
    question: "What coverage limits meet my needs?",
    answer: "  For Own Damage, the Sum Insured for the vehicle is called ‘Insured Declared Value’ and should reflect the current market value of the vehicle. For Third Party Liability cover, there is unlimited coverage for death/injuries to Third Parties, however, Third party property damages are covered up to a sum of Rs.750,000. Insured has option to restrict coverage for Third Party Property damage to Rs.6,000 whereby there will be reduction in Liability Only premium."
}, {
    question: "Which policy should I purchase for my new Private Car or new Two-Wheeler?",
    answer: " You can either purchase Bundled Policy or Long-Term Liability Only Policy for term of 3 year and 5 year for new Private Car and new Two-Wheeler respectively. However, annual Package or annual Liability only policy for new Private Car or New Two Wheeler is not available as it is not permitted."
}, {
    question: "When should I renew the Bundled Policy?",
    answer: "  Own-Damage (OD) cover under Bundled Policy is valid for period of one year and hence, OD section should be renewed on expiry of one-year period. However, Third Party cover under the Bundled Policy is valid for three years (for new Private Cars) or five years (for new Two-wheelers) and hence, it should be renewed on expiry of 3 or 5 year period as the case may be."
}, {
    question: "When should I approach Insurance company for renewal of my policy?",
    answer: " You should approach Insurance company at least 15 days before expiry of your existing policy period."
}, {
    question: " What is Add-on Cover?",
    answer: "Add-on cover extends the cover under the base policy on payment of additional premium. Different Insurers have different Add-ons available with them. Nil Depreciation Cover, Return to Invoice Cover, No Claim Bonus Protection are some of the most common Add-on covers present in the market. You can visit the IRDAI website (irdai.gov.in) for detailed coverage of under these add-ons."
}, {
    question: "What is No Claim Bonus?",
    answer: "No Claim Bonus (NCB) is the benefit accrued to an insured for NIL claims during the previous policy period. As per current norms prevalent, it ranges from 20% on the Own Damage premium (and not on Liability premium) and progressively increases to a maximum of 50% based on successive claim free years. If; however, a claim is lodged, the No claim Bonus is lost in the subsequent policy period. NCB is given to insured and not to the insured vehicle. Hence, on transfer of the vehicle, the insurance policy can be transferred to new owner but not the NCB. The new owner has to pay the difference on account of NCB for the balance policy period. The original owner can, however, use the NCB on a new vehicle purchased by him."
}, {
    question: "Will my No Claim Bonus (NCB) get ported if I want to change my insurance company?",
    answer: "Yes, you can avail of the NCB facility if you change the insurer on renewal. You would have to produce proof of the NCB earned by way of renewal notice from the current insurer. If the same cannot be produced, you may produce your original expiring policy along with a certification that no claim has been lodged by yourself on the expiring policy. Hence, evidence can be in form of a renewal notice or a letter confirming the NCB entitlement from the previous insurer."
}, {
    question: "Is GST applicable and how much is it?",
    answer: "Yes, GST is applicable and would be as per prevailing rule of law. "
}, {
    question: " What are the documents to be kept in the vehicle while plying in public places?",
    answer: " Certificate of Insurance, Xerox copy of Registration Certificate, Pollution under control Certificate (PUC), Copy of DL of person who drives the vehicle"
}, {
    question: " I have lost the insurance policy. Can I get a duplicate one?",
    answer: "Yes, please approach the same office, which had issued the policy, with a written request. A nominal fee is charged for issuing duplicate policy copy."
}, {
    question: "Is PUC Certificate mandatory for renewing the Motor Insurance policy?",
    answer: "Yes it is mandatory to have a valid PUC Certificate on the date of renewal of the insurance policy."
